This is just a simple automated scripting setup for Ubuntu 16.04 for my environment that includes the following:
Disabling apport
Installation of openssh-server
Installation of x11vnc
Installation of FreeRDP 2.0.0-rc0
It also includes multiple .desktop files that are configured to connect to windows servers via FreeRDP with multi-monitor support (independant support, not spanning so each application launched in a window will snap full screen to that window and not across all monitors.) Copy the shortcut(s) to the desktop and chmod +x them.
